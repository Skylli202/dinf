`dinf` stands for directory information.
It is a (very) small CLI application that:

- Count the files in the current working directory.
  - (opt.) Count the files recursively.
  - (opt.) Output only the file count instead of a human friendly sentence.
- Size of the current working directory
  - (opt.) Size the files recursively.
  - (opt.) Output only the file count instead of a human friendly sentence
  (to be developed).

... many more features to come

## Goals

The goals of this (very) small project is to practice Golang development:
it's pattern, it's standard library.
While also practicing on developing tests at various levels.
Here both the internals and the top-level CLI is tested.
